# üöó ESP32 Wi-Fi RC Car (MQTT Controlled)

This project demonstrates a fully remote-controlled RC car using an **ESP32**, a **brushless motor with ESC**, and an **Android phone** as the communication hub and camera. Commands are sent wirelessly over **MQTT**, and live video is streamed using the phone‚Äôs camera.

## üì¶ Features

- Real-time control of an RC car over Wi-Fi
- MQTT communication between Android + ESP32
- Live IP camera feed from Android phone
- Web-based dashboard with PS4 controller support üéÆ
- Gear-based speed system with smooth throttle
- Interactive hardware diagram & modular design
